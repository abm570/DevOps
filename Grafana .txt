1️⃣ What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source visualization and monitoring tool.

It allows you to create interactive dashboards from different data sources.

Used widely for DevOps, server monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, and metrics visualization.

2️⃣ Key Components of Grafana

Data Sources – Connect to databases or monitoring systems.

Examples: Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Loki, CloudWatch.

Dashboards – Collections of visual panels (graphs, tables, gauges) that display data.

Panels – Individual visualizations in a dashboard.

Types: Graph, Table, Stat, Gauge, Heatmap, Pie Chart.

Alerts – Can trigger notifications if a metric crosses a threshold.

Users & Teams – Role-based access for collaboration.

Plugins – Extend Grafana’s functionality (data sources, panels, apps).

Users interact through Web UI or API.

Grafana queries the data sources in real-time.

It doesn’t store metrics itself (except dashboards, users, and configuration in a database).


2️⃣ Advantages of Grafana
Advantage	Explanation
Multiple Data Sources	Connects to Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and more.
Beautiful Dashboards	Offers graphs, tables, heatmaps, gauges, and alert panels.
Alerts & Notifications	Can trigger alerts based on thresholds via email, Slack, Teams, etc.
Flexible Queries	Supports custom queries for visualizing complex metrics.
Open-Source & Extensible	Free to use, with plugins and community dashboards available.
Real-time Monitoring	Updates dashboards live as data changes.
Team Collaboration	Share dashboards and organize with folders.
3️⃣ How to Connect Grafana to Jenkins

You can visualize build metrics from Jenkins in Grafana.

Steps:

Install Jenkins plugin for metrics

Install Prometheus Plugin in Jenkins:

Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available → Prometheus Metrics Plugin → Install


Enable metrics endpoint

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Enable Prometheus endpoint


This exposes Jenkins metrics at:

http://<jenkins-ip>:<port>/prometheus


Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana

Grafana → Settings (gear icon) → Data Sources → Add Data Source → Prometheus

URL: http://<jenkins-ip>:<port>

Click Save & Test

Create dashboards

Use prebuilt Jenkins dashboards from Grafana library or build your own to visualize builds, pipelines, success/failure rate, etc.

4️⃣ How to Connect Grafana to Docker (Container Metrics)

You can monitor Docker containers with Grafana using cAdvisor + Prometheus:

Steps:

Run cAdvisor

docker run \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --publish=8080:8080 \
  --detach=true \
  --name=cadvisor \
  google/cadvisor:latest


cAdvisor exposes container metrics at:

http://<server-ip>:8080/metrics


Set up Prometheus to scrape cAdvisor

Add to prometheus.yml:

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'cadvisor'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<server-ip>:8080']


Restart Prometheus.

Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana

URL: http://<prometheus-ip>:9090

Save & Test

Create dashboards

Use prebuilt Docker dashboards or visualize CPU, memory, network, and disk usage for containers.
